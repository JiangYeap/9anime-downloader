# 9anime Downloader

This module offers a simple solution to the anime hoarding weebs in the world like me. The script downloads anime episodes directly from the "https://ww.9animes.net/" domain (this is not the official 9anime site and has a more limited selection of shows, but offers more freedom on video quality).

## Usage

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies. 
2. Run `python downloader.py <9ANIME_SERIES_URL>"` for direct download or `"python downloader.py <SERIES_NAME> -s"` to search for series.
3. Example series URL: "https://ww.9animes.net/one-punch-man-english-subbed/", example series name: "One Punch Man".

## Requirements

- This script has been tested on both python 2.7.13 and python 3.7.1.
